Network Flow Algorithms
Welcome to the Network Flow Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of various network flow algorithms used in computer science and operations research. These algorithms are crucial for solving problems related to the movement of resources through a network, such as transportation, logistics, and communication networks.

Network flow algorithms are designed to find the optimal way to send flow through a network. A network consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (arcs) with capacities that limit the amount of flow that can pass through. The goal is to determine the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node while respecting the capacity constraints.
